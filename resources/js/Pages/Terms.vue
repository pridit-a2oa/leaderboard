                    The information provided when using the Services is not
                    intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity
                    in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or
                    use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would
                    subject us to any registration requirement within such
                    jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
                    choose to access the Services from other locations do so on
                    their own initiative and are solely responsible for
                    compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws

                <p>
                    The Services are not tailored to comply with
                    industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability
                    and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security
                    Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would
                    be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You
                    may not use the Services in a way that would violate the
                    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

                    including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by
                    any third party due to or arising out of: (1) use of the

                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at your

                    agree to cooperate, at your expense, with our defence of
                    such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of

                    this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.

                <p>
                    These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted
                    by us on the Services or in respect to the Services
                    constitute the entire agreement and understanding between
                    you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
                    provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver
                    of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the
                    fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all
                    of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We
                    shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
                    delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our
                    reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision
                    of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or
                    unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
                    deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect
                    the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
                    There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
                    relationship created between you and us as a result of these
                    Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these
                    Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of
                    having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defences
                    you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal
                    Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to
